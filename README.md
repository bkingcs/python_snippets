# python_snippets

I've been teaching a course in Data Mining for quite some time. I recently moved the course from R
 to Python, and largely have been enjoying it. In time, I hope to collect a large number of small examples of useful snippets here, and I promise I will do my best to reference all examples scattered throughout Github, and the interwebs in general.
